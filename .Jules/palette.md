**Learning:** Users often struggle with "recommended length" text instructions. Providing real-time visual feedback (color changes) as they type reduces cognitive load and anxiety about hitting limits.
**Action:** Always pair text-based constraints (min/max length) with a dynamic indicator that changes state (neutral -> valid -> warning) to guide the user.
