## 2026-02-04 - Dynamic Feedback for Constraints
**Learning:** Static instructions (e.g., "Recommended length: 60 chars") are easily ignored. Dynamic feedback that updates as the user types (e.g., "45/60") creates a tighter feedback loop and "gamifies" compliance.
**Action:** Always pair character limits with dynamic counters that change visual state (e.g., gray to red) to indicate validation status.
